        <p>In League of Legends, Sion is a fearsome and versatile champion known for his relentless strength and durability. As an undead juggernaut, Sion harnesses the power of undeath, making him a formidable force both in the top lane and as a tanky jungler. His passive, "Glory in Death," allows Sion to continue fighting even after falling in battle, granting him a final chance to wreak havoc on enemies with reduced health. His Q ability, "Decimating Smash," unleashes a powerful axe swing, dealing significant damage and knocking enemies up in its path. Sion's W, "Soul Furnace," grants him a shield that absorbs damage and can be detonated to deal area-of-effect damage. His E, "Roar of the Slayer," hurls a projectile that slows and damages foes hit. Finally, his ultimate, "Unstoppable Onslaught," charges in a targeted direction, crashing through enemy champions and terrain, causing massive disruption and initiating fights. Sion's playstyle revolves around engaging head-on, absorbing damage, and disrupting the enemy team with his crowd control, making him a valuable asset in teamfights and a nightmare for opponents who underestimate his unyielding might.

        <h1> TIP 1: Watch TheBausffs </h1>
        <img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lolesports_gamepedia_en/images/2/2c/LEC_Thebausffs_2021.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210716154318" alt="the goat">
        
        <h2>TheBausffs is the goat at Sion. He is most formerly known for his "Inting Sion", where he runs it down top and takes all of the opposing team's towers. TheBausffs claims that no death is meaningless, and that taking the enemies' towers is worth feeding your opposing top laner and going 0/20. Mastering the art of INTING is what separates the noob sion players from the pros, a notion best reflected through TheBausffs' gameplay.  </h2>
        <h2> Here are some of my favorite quotes of TheBausffs</h2>
        <h3>"Wp gg ðŸ˜€"</h3>
        <h3>"Joking ðŸ˜‚"</h3>
        <h3>"We shilling ðŸ˜Ž"</h3>
        <h3>"Solobolo ðŸ˜±"</h3>

        <h2>TIP 2: Int Your Teammates </h2>

        <h2>Unlike Yasuo, who does not hit his powerspike until 0/10, Sion gets stronger the more times he dies. Because sion respawns after every death, you can run it down mid and take all of your opponents towers. Doesn't matter if you int ur teammates so long as you win.</h2>

        <h2>TIP 3: Flame Your Teammates in All Chat </h2>
        <img src = "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S9R3WBSYdcI/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="facts">
        
        <h2> Flaming your teammates is the best form of encouragement. If they are playing like absolute dogshit then let them know and they will play better. Note that shitting on your teammates in all chat is especially effective as to allow the enemy team to join in as well. If you lose, remember to spread some kindness and blame them for feeding</h2>
